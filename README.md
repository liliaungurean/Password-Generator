Once they click that they are prompted with the window, asking to choose the length of the password between eight and 128 characters. After they have made their selections, they are prompted with another window asking if they want lowercase letters given the choice of yes or cancel(no). After that additional windows will pop up and users will be prompted to answer yes or no (cancel) to whether they want capital letters, special characters and numbers. Once that is all completed the user will be presented with a generated password.
